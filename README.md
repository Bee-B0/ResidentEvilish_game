# ResidentEvilish_game
My unity project. Work in progress.

Current ideas:
* shooter game fighting zombies
* a wave mode where zombs come from multiple directions (arcade mode)
* add a friend ^ to that mode. (2 player)
* try and make a short game with story dialouge and npcs in order to learn how to.
